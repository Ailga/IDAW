        <h1>The course I followed</h1>
            <h2>My Scolarship</h2>
                <h3>Engineering School</h2>
                    <p>I came in IMT Nord Europe in 2020. <br>
                    There, I had a first year of general classes then a second one during which I specialised in computer science, more precisely in Networks and Web Developpement.
                    <br> I did two projects during those two years. The first one was the development of a video game that allows players to learn the French Sign Language. My second project was a short memoir concerning the different state's strategies on cyberspace.
                    <br> This school also allows us to get interested in community life in which I deeply got involved. I got in the communication pole of the Theater club, the board games club, and the BDH (humanitarian office). I also got in as the secretary of the Telethon association.</p>
                <h3>Preparatory class</h2>
                    <p>I entered a BCPST (Bilogy, Chemistry, Physics and Geology) preparatory class in 2017. It took place in the Lycée Fénelon (Paris VI). I spent 3 years there.
                        <br> During this time, I learned how to be rigourous and regular in my work. I also learned how to deal with a lot of stress.
                    </p>
            <h2>Professional experiments</h2>
                <h3>Engineer Internship : project management</h2>
                    <p>I carried out my first engineer intership at Renault company. My tasks there were the following ones:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Update and automating of the heads of units and the workshop head's dasboards.</li>
                        <li>Production analysis in order to find the source of a problem</li>
                        <li>Installation of a manager for dealer label printers</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Seasonnal employment - Waitress</h2>
                    <p>I worked as a waitress in a pizzeria-restaurant on Oleron Island. It was during the summer of the year 2018. This seasonal employment allowed me to acquire softskills such as communicating with a client, organisation and reactivity. 
                        <br>This experience allowed me to develop my autonomy. It was my first immersion in the world of work.
