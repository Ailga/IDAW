        <h1>My motives</h1>
            <h2>A lifeful young woman</h2>
                <p>As an optimistic person, I am used to see the glass half full.<br>
                   This page will allow me to prove it to you. 
                </p>
                <h3>Enthusiasm</h3>
                    <p>It is important to me to find a positive side to everything I do. Otherwise, what is the point in doing it? One day, after watching Alice in Wonderland (by Tim Burton), I started imagining 6 impossible things every morning before breakfast. 
                        Here are those of today:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Birds can speak</li>
                        <li>There is a place where trees are made of candy</li>
                        <li>The water has memory</li>
                        <li>Warthogs, meerkats and lions get along well</li>
                        <li>Toys are alive</li>
                        <li>A kiss can wake up one from an eternal rest</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>As you may have guessed, I am a huge fan of Disney.  This companie's feature films accompanied me during my growth and never left me since then. But be <strong>careful</strong>, it does not mean that I only am a child!</p>

                <h3>Empathy</h3>
                    <p>Even though I sometimes say somethings wrong, as everyone does, I tend to know how to listen and answer people. To put myself in someone's place is not a difficult exerciceto me.<br>
                    Obviously, knowing how to keep distances before being overwhelmed is more than important. I tend to think that a compromise is always the best solution.</p> 
                    
                <h3>My values</h3>
                    <p>I grew up in a family where solidarity was the principle value. Thus, it is something that matters to me. We always are close-knitted and we always sticked together towards adversity.
                        Respect, sharing, humility and honesty are also values that my mother handed over me through the years. 
                    </p>
